# Pyt-Ex
just something for easy use of PyTorch
The project is built on top of pytorch to train multiple neural network architecture in one go and store how each network is doing at each step and making a dashboard eventually to see and compare different architectures.
The philosophy of this project is to make researchers from different fields just write a config of all architectures they want and just loading and fitting the config will give them the best architecture
